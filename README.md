# Neural Network from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project implements a basic neural network in Python using only NumPy. It includes custom implementations of dense layers and the application of activation functions to understand the foundational concepts of neural networks.

## Features
- Implementation of dense layers using loop-based and vectorized approaches.
- Custom activation functions, including sigmoid and ReLU.
- Example usage with synthetic data to demonstrate forward propagation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Installation

Clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-from-scratch.git
cd neural-network-from-scratch
